# RestApp
> A RESTful Trello-like task managing App using Angular 7, Java Spring Boot and MongoDB.

## Motivation
This is a learning app where the idea is to constantly keep working on features and aspects of the Task Manager. I wrote this app to learn more about Full-Stack Development and the best way I could actually learn was by writing code. Inspiration taken from Trello.

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
